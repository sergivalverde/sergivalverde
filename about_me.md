## About me

I'm Sergi Valverde, PhD, MBA. During the last 8 years, I have been designing
and developing open-source neuroimaging software at the
Institute of Computer Vision and Robotics
[(VICOROB)](www.vicorob.udg.edu) of the [Universtiy of Girona](www.udg.edu), mostly related to Multiple
Sclerosis (MS) tissue and lesion segmentation.

Since mid 2020, I'm a co-founder and CEO of
[tensormedical](http://www.tensormedical.ai), a spin-off company of the
[Universtiy of Girona](www.udg.edu) and the [Vall d'Hebron
Hospital](www.vhir.org) in Barcelona. At tensormedical, we work to
help clinical experts to improve care for patients suffering MS. We are developing unique and automated artificial
intelligence tools to reduce the error associated with visual reading
of magnetic resonance images of patients, offering unprecedented
sensitivity and specificity detecting new appearing lesions.
